    "# Introduction into Data Science - Assignment Part II\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second part of the assignment in IDS 2023/2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the assignment consists of five questions — each of these questions is contained in a separate Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "- [Question 1: Data Preprocessing](Q1_Preprocessing_Visualization.ipynb)\n",
    "- [Question 2: Association Rules](Q2_Frequent_Itemsets_Association_Rules.ipynb)\n",
    "- [Question 3: Process Mining](Q3_Process_Mining.ipynb)\n",
    "- [Question 4: Text Mining](Q4_Text_Mining.ipynb)\n",
    "- [Question 5: Big Data](Q5_Big_Data.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional required files are in two folders.\n",
    "- [datasets](datasets/)\n",
    "- [scripts](scripts/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please use the provided notebook to work on the questions. When you are done, upload your version of each of the notebooks to Moodle. Your submission will, therefore, consist of five jupyter notebook and _no_ additional file. Any additionally provided files will not be considered in grading.\n",
    "Enter your commented Python code and answers in the corresponding cells. Make sure to answer all questions in a clear and explicit manner and discuss your outputs. _Please do not change the general structure of this notebook_. You can, however, add additional markdown or code cells if necessary. Please **DO NOT CLEAR THE OUTPUT** of the notebook you are submitting! Additionally, please ensure that the code in the notebook runs if placed in the same folder as all of the provided files, delivering the same outputs as the ones you submit in the notebook. This includes being runnable in the bundled conda environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Please make sure to include the names and matriculation numbers of all group members in the provided slots in each of the notebooks.* If a name or a student id is missing, the student will not receive any points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 1: **Plan your time wisely.** A few parts of this assignment may take some time to run. It might be necessary to consider time management when you plan your group work. Also, do not attempt to upload your assignment at the last minute before the deadline. This often does not work, and you will miss the deadline. Late submissions will not be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 2: RWTHMoodle allows multiple submissions, with every new submission overwriting the previous one. **Partial submissions are possible and encouraged.** This might be helpful in case of technical issues with RWTHMoodle, which may occur close to the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 3: As a technical note. Some IDEs such as DataSpell may automatically strip jupyter notebook cell metadata. If you are able, please re-add it from the source notebooks before submission. This is necessary for our grading."

The reason for that could be that the frequency of the most frequent album has not a big enough gap in compare to others, in this case it is around 0.14 and is similar to the accuracy score. Overall the accuracy score of SGD classifier is not high but still higher than the most frequent guessing classifier."

    "Apply DBSCAN with euclidean distance to the `embeddings_df`dataframe with `eps = 0.3` and `min_samples = 2` and create a scatterplot with seaborn that shows the clusters of the inferred vectors. To be able to visualize the data in a two-dimensional vector space, apply a **p**rinciple **c**omponent **a**nalysis that is able to reduce the dimensionality of input data. (You can learn more about the PCA in its [Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)). The code for the PCA is provided."
