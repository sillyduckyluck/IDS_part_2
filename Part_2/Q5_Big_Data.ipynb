    "# Introduction into Data Science - Assignment Part II\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second part of the assignment in IDS 2023/2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the assignment consists of five questions — each of these questions is contained in a separate Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "- [Question 1: Data Preprocessing](Q1_Preprocessing_Visualization.ipynb)\n",
    "- [Question 2: Association Rules](Q2_Frequent_Itemsets_Association_Rules.ipynb)\n",
    "- [Question 3: Process Mining](Q3_Process_Mining.ipynb)\n",
    "- [Question 4: Text Mining](Q4_Text_Mining.ipynb)\n",
    "- [Question 5: Big Data](Q5_Big_Data.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional required files are in two folders.\n",
    "- [datasets](datasets/)\n",
    "- [scripts](scripts/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please use the provided notebook to work on the questions. When you are done, upload your version of each of the notebooks to Moodle. Your submission will, therefore, consist of five jupyter notebook and _no_ additional file. Any additionally provided files will not be considered in grading.\n",
    "Enter your commented Python code and answers in the corresponding cells. Make sure to answer all questions in a clear and explicit manner and discuss your outputs. _Please do not change the general structure of this notebook_. You can, however, add additional markdown or code cells if necessary. Please **DO NOT CLEAR THE OUTPUT** of the notebook you are submitting! Additionally, please ensure that the code in the notebook runs if placed in the same folder as all of the provided files, delivering the same outputs as the ones you submit in the notebook. This includes being runnable in the bundled conda environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Please make sure to include the names and matriculation numbers of all group members in the provided slots in each of the notebooks.* If a name or a student id is missing, the student will not receive any points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 1: **Plan your time wisely.** A few parts of this assignment may take some time to run. It might be necessary to consider time management when you plan your group work. Also, do not attempt to upload your assignment at the last minute before the deadline. This often does not work, and you will miss the deadline. Late submissions will not be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 2: RWTHMoodle allows multiple submissions, with every new submission overwriting the previous one. **Partial submissions are possible and encouraged.** This might be helpful in case of technical issues with RWTHMoodle, which may occur close to the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 3: As a technical note. Some IDEs such as DataSpell may automatically strip jupyter notebook cell metadata. If you are able, please re-add it from the source notebooks before submission. This is necessary for our grading."

    "3. You do not have to \"go beyond\" the provided stream objects. When we ask for e.g. \"the number of edits\", we are always referring to what the `wiki_edits_stream` provides. You do not have to tune the stream settings or filters to somehow attempt to determine what you think is the \"true\" value.\n",
    "4. The API wrapper we use here sometimes prints errors (in red) when an API response appears to be incompletely transmitted. This can happen, you do not have to fix this or correct for it; simply ignore it.\n",
    "5. You can freely edit cells with a `# configuration` comment; you do not have to recreate the initial state. In the same manner, you can create additional cells for your debugging etc. Just make sure to not change the structure of explicit solution cells that contain `# YOUR CODE HERE` or \"__Student Answer:__ _your answer here_\".\n",

    "\n",
    "Get yourself familiar with the provided utility code that connects to the API and receives all edit and page creation events that occur on wikis operated by the Wikimedia foundation. \\\n",
    "To do so, have a look at the following provided code snippet.\n",
    "It's a simple processing loop that prints for each event the following information in a readable manner:\n",
    "- the (wiki) domain\n",
    "- the edited/created page title\n",
    "- the username (\"user_text\") and user account age in days (using \"user_registration_dt\"), if available\n",
    "- revision content type and length\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows you how to iterate over the event stream using our utility code. The event processing loop runs continuously in the background, however after `AUTO_STOP_TIME`, the loop is automatically terminated to stop infinite loops and breaking the notebook with the huge amount of console output. This variable is used in all tasks and you can edit it as you like for your testing.\n",
    "You can also manually terminate the background processing with the `Switch` object returned by `run_loop`.\n",
    "The following code cells show some exemplary usage. Note that this co-routine-based execution swallows exceptions which means your function might raise an exception that does not show up in the notebook console. You can assess whether an exception occurred (e.g., due to a programming mistake) via calling `[your task].exception()` as you can see a few cells below."

    "As a thought experiment, let's assume that instead of this approximation you wanted to calculate the exact heavy hitters and were ready to save the streamed data (over a certain time frame) to disk.\\\n",

    "\n",
    "To warm up, take a look at the following example as a way to structure and express a sequence of map-reduce tasks. Read this thoroughly, so that you can answer the next question properly. Note that though we use python code combined with pseudo-code/comments, the cell is not intended to be executed in this notebook. It is merely to describe the functions as precisely as possible without requiring an extensive technical setup.\n",

    "Recall the map/reduce definitions presented in the lecture.\n",
